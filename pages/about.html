            <p>
                I was born on July 12, 1994 in Dnipro. I grew up here as well as studied and married.
                I am interested in meeting and communicating with new people, although this is not always easy for me.
                I also love traveling with my wife, visiting new places and trying new dishes. We visited with her Vilnius and Budapest, as well as many cities in Ukraine.
                I also like cars, I drive well and I understand them technically.
                As for my character, I think that I am rather modest and calm. My friends tell me that I have a good sense of humor.
                I like everything good and positive, and when I have problems, I always try to find positive moments in them. I love helping people around me and watching them become happy with my help. I also like to participate in various activities, create something, I consider myself a creative person.
                And that's all I would like to tell you about myself
